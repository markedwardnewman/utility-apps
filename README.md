# A Functional Folder Monitoring Tool...

**"All this aggravation ain't satisfactioning me"**<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Elvis Presley

## What it does
- Monitors specified directories across any-sized network for file-related events
- Throws easily-seen visual alerts in real-time when specified breaches occur (like when a folder exceeds a certain amount of files)
- Can automatically open offending directories
- Suggested use is to run it on a machine with a large, highly visible display

## Behold! The FolderMonitoringTool...

## Set up
The FolderMonitoringTool.exe knows which folders to monitor by reading the paths specified in the paths.txt file.

- The paths.txt file must reside in the same directory / folder that the FolderMonitoringTool.exe is ran from
- Click the events tab to manages thresholds to be watched for

*This program enables automation. System administrators should weigh heavily the consequences such a powerful tool can bring about, lest their own roles become obsolete

**Support technicians should have confirmed plans in place to move to a country that supports a living wage *before* releasing to production

***It is strongly encouraged that an air of perceived complexity be invoked during set-up. To maintain this illusion, please use an overly-complicated batch script to output the simple .txt that contains the paths of the directories to be monitored
